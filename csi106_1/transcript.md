(Do some introductions perhaps)

# PART 1

Hello everyone today our team would like to talk about free software.
The first question I would like to ask is: "what do YOU think is free software?"

(Audience answers (or move on if no one answers))

(Reveal "respects the user's freedom")

(ADLIB: depending on the answer)
- IF the audience answers something like "not paid"

That's correct, however, there is another meaning to the word "free" .....

- IF the audience answers something like "freedom"

That's correct, indeed, "free software" means **software without restrictions**.

To differentiate between the 2 meanings of the word, we usually use *2 distinct words* instead:

("Gratis" slide)

**Gratis**, means free as in not paid, no cost, no money.

But the meaning we are talking about is actually "libre".

("Libre" slide)

This is a French or Spanish word, meaning "free from difficulty and obstacles".

When we say software is *libre*, we mean that software **does not restrict** or **mistreat** the user in any way.

(Stress this part below, it's important)

Do note however, that libre software ***DOES NOT*** automatically make it gratis. 

Libre software ***can*** be paid, as long as they follow **the 4 freedoms** of free software.

("Four freedoms" slide)

The [Free Software Foundation](https://fsf.org), the pioneer of the Free Software Movement, has established the *4 core freedoms*:
- The freedom to run software as you wish, without restrictions
- The freedom to study, analyze, change, modify software, without restrictions
- The freedom to redistribute copies of software, without restrictions
- The freedom to distribute modified versions of software, without restrictions

If a piece of software satisfies these 4 freedoms, they are *libre*.

So, free software can be paid, can cost money, as long as they can satisfy these freedoms.

# PART 2

("So what?" slide)

After listening through all that, you may be asking yourself: "So what? Why should I care?"

(Reveal "the world" text)

(Reveal chart)

The reason I think you should care is that the world literally runs on free software.

Linux powers over 60% of the world's servers. The "cloud" is 60% Linux.

Linux is, indeed, free, libre, open source software, made possible by the contributions of thousands and thousands of people.

("You are in control" slide)

(Reveal "right to repair")

Furthermore, simply by being open source, you can benefit from a community forever.

A 10 year old phone may be unsupported by the company that made it, but with a community around the open source software, that phone can continue enjoying updates.

(Reveal "change it!")

If you don't like something about an app, change it yourself, and contribute it back.

(Reveal the last 2 lines)

Libre software means they are developed upon open standards. That makes your data portable.

This means you can bring your data anywhere, instead of being locked into a specific company's ecosystem.

("Can't compete" slide)

And by their nature of being open source, the entire world develops them instead of a few people hired by a company.

This tiny picture I had to cram in is the full list of video and audio formats supported by ffmpeg.

This means you can convert to *and* from all these formats. For free, offline.

(Next slide)

Or these...

yt-dlp: download videos and music from thousands of sites

pandoc: convert to *and* from 60 markup formats. PDF, raw text, Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Markdown, HTML, EPUB, etc.

Blender: arguably the best 3D modeling software

Godot Engine: libre game engine. Lightweight, full-featured, and free!

# PART 3

("GIMP" slide)

But of course, free software means mostly unpaid, thankless work. And there isn't always alternatives to non-free software.

GIMP is often mentioned as a libre alternative to Photoshop, but that really isn't the case in reality.

The PSD file format that Photoshop uses is non-free, closed, owned by Adobe only.

So, not many software other than Photoshop can open those files.

("Hardware" slide)

Your hardware also isn't libre. The CPU, the mainboard, the GPU, the keyboard, the lights, the firmware, the drivers often aren't free.

There isn't much we can do. Corporations intentionally prevent people from reverse-engineering their hardware, so no one can write libre drivers for them.

("Easy thing to do" slide)

But you can help!

The easiest way to start is to just use Firefox instead of Chrome.

After that, you can explore alternatives to non-free software you use daily.

("Spread the word" slide)

You can also help by spreading the word. The more people know about Free software, the better.

# Q&A

That's the end of our presentation. We will be taking questions, if you have any.
